We will show how to move beyond the classic graphs produced in base R or with {ggplot2} to explore the interactive dataviz production libraries of JavaScript, particularly the Chart.js library.**\n\nIf you missed <a href=\"https://rtask.thinkr.fr/pimping-your-shiny-app-with-a-javascript-library-an-example-using-sweetalert2/\" target=\"_blank\">my first article on integrating JavaScript libraries into a {shiny} application</a> I invite you to read it before diving into this one.\n\nCrucial concepts are covered and will not be repeated here. We particularly think about:\n\n- How to add a JavaScript library's dependencies to a {shiny} application  \n- How to call JavaScript code from R\n\n## TL;DR\n\n- Creating interactive charts that go beyond the usual dataviz produced in R is possible by integrating a JavaScript library!\n- \n  - We use the example of Chart.js, a very popular JavaScript dataviz library\n  - Specificities related to integrating Chart.js into a `{shiny}` application are addressed, including passing data from R to JavaScript and the differences in expected data formats.\n  - We'll see how to make sure our JavaScript code is working properly by using the web browser's console.\n\n## Importing Chart.js into a `{shiny}` app created with `{golem}`\n\n- Chart.js is a JavaScript library that allows you to create many types of charts (bars, lines, radar, etc.) and customize them as you wish\n- It is very well documented\n- It is the most popular JavaScript dataviz library on GitHub (over 60,000 \"stars\" at the time of this article's publication)\n\nTo get an overview of the possibilities offered by Chart.js, visit the official page: https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/samples/information.html\n\n### Add the dependencies to Chart.js in your {shiny} app\n\n**The following sections assume that you have already created a `{shiny}` app with `{golem}`.**\n\nIf this is not the case and you want to learn more about `{golem}`, I invite you to consult the <a href=\"https://thinkr-open.github.io/golem/\" target=\"_blank\">official documentation</a>.\n\nTo add Chart.js to your `{shiny}` app, you will need to find a way to incorporate the necessary files for its operation into your application. As we saw in our previous article, two solutions are possible.\n\n- Use a \"CDN\" (Content Delivery Network) to load the files from a third-party server.\n- Download the necessary files and integrate them directly into the application.\n\nWe will use the \"CDN\" method here.\n\nGo to the <a href=\"https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/getting-started/\" target=\"_blank\"> \"Getting Started\" section of Chart.js documentation </a>.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/01-cdn.png){width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWe retrieve the CDN URL and store this information for later use.\n\nAfter creating the skeleton of an application via `{golem}`, we will add the Chart.js dependency.\n\nLet's open the `R/app_ui.R` file of our application and add the link we copied earlier into the body of the `golem_add_external_resources()` function.\n\n``` r\ngolem_add_external_resources <- function() {\n  add_resource_path(\n    \"www\",\n    app_sys(\"app/www\")\n  )\n  \n  tags$head(\n    favicon(),\n    bundle_resources(\n      path = app_sys(\"app/www\"),\n      app_title = \"chartJS\"\n    ),\n    # Add here other external resources\n    # for example, you can add shinyalert::useShinyalert()\n    # Chart.js\n    tags$script(src = \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js\")\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### How to know if Chart.js is properly imported ?\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/getting-started/\" target=\"_blank\"> \"Getting Started\"</a> section previously consulted to retrieve the CDN link indicates that it is necessary to incorporate the HTML `<canvas>` tag into our application to display a Chart.js chart. We add this element to the `R/app_ui.R` file of our application.\n\n\n``` r\napp_ui <- function(request) {\n  tagList(\n    # Leave this function for adding external resources\n    golem_add_external_resources(),\n    # Your application UI logic\n    fluidPage(\n      h1(\"golemchartjs\"),\n      tags$div(\n        tags$canvas(id=\"myChart\")\n      )\n    )\n  )\n}\n```\n\nTo verify that Chart.js is properly imported into our application, we run our app with `golem::run_dev()`, and the rest will take place in the web browser.\n\n**NB: The following screenshots were taken using the Google Chrome browser.**\n\nIn the window of our application, right-click and then select \"Inspect\". In the new window that opens, choose the \"Console\" tab and type the command to generate a Chart.js chart, as indicated once again in the <a href=\"https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/getting-started/\" target=\"_blank\"> \"Getting Started\"</a> section between the HTML `script` tags.\n\nThe code to copy and paste into the console is the following:\n\n``` javascript\n  const ctx = document.getElementById('myChart');\n\n  new Chart(ctx, {\n    type: 'bar',\n    data: {\n      labels: ['Red', 'Blue', 'Yellow', 'Green', 'Purple', 'Orange'],\n      datasets: [{\n        label: '# of Votes',\n        data: [12, 19, 3, 5, 2, 3],\n        borderWidth: 1\n      }]\n    },\n    options: {\n      scales: {\n        y: {\n          beginAtZero: true\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  });\n```\n\n<img src=\"img/02-example_chartJS.gif\" width=\"80%\" />\n\nThe chart from the demo page appears as expected! 🎉 \n\nWe can move on! 😊 \n\nThe application code for this step is available here: https://github.com/ymansiaux/golemchartjs/tree/step1\n\n## Creating a Bar Chart with Chart.js\n\nThe code used previously allowed us to verify that Chart.js was properly imported into our application. Now, we will see how to create a Chart.js chart from our `{shiny}` application. The goal is to produce bar charts for various datasets with customizable options based on user choices.\n\nLet's revisit the code executed previously:\n\n``` javascript\n  const ctx = document.getElementById('myChart');\n\n  new Chart(ctx, {\n    type: 'bar',\n    data: {\n      labels: ['Red', 'Blue', 'Yellow', 'Green', 'Purple', 'Orange'],\n      datasets: [{\n        label: '# of Votes',\n        data: [12, 19, 3, 5, 2, 3],\n        borderWidth: 1\n      }]\n    },\n    options: {\n      scales: {\n        y: {\n          beginAtZero: true\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  });\n```\n\nWe could imagine passing the `labels`, `label`, `data`, and `borderWidth` elements as function parameters.\n\nLet's go! 🚀\n\n### Creating a JavaScript code usable from R\n\nWe saw in our previous article that the way to call JavaScript code from R is to use a \"JS handler\". To do this, go to the `dev/02_dev.R` file! We add the following line in the \"External Resources\" section:\n\n``` r\ngolem::add_js_handler(\"barchartJS\")\n```\n\nWe fill in the skeleton by indicating \"barchartJS\" as the name of our handler and adding the JavaScript code we saw previously.\n\n``` javascript\n$(document).ready(function () {\n  Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler(\"barchartJS\", function (arg) {\n    const ctx = document.getElementById(\"myChart\");\n\n    new Chart(ctx, {\n      type: \"bar\",\n      data: {\n        labels: [\"Red\", \"Blue\", \"Yellow\", \"Green\", \"Purple\", \"Orange\"],\n        datasets: [\n          {\n            label: \"# of Votes\",\n            data: [12, 19, 3, 5, 2, 3],\n            borderWidth: 1,\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n      options: {\n        scales: {\n          y: {\n            beginAtZero: true,\n          },\n        },\n      },\n    });\n  });\n});\n\n```\n\nWe replace the `labels`, `label`, `data`, and `borderWidth` parameters, which are hardcoded here, with the future elements passed as arguments to our handler. The notation to use here will be `arg.param_name` to access the values passed by our `{shiny}` application. The `.` notation is a JavaScript convention for accessing properties of an object. To draw a parallel with R, it's somewhat like using `arg$param_name`.\n\nAt the beginning of our handler, we add a call to the `console.log()` function to check the contents of the `arg` element from the JS console. This will allow us to verify that the elements passed from R are correctly transmitted to our handler.\n\n``` javascript\n$( document ).ready(function() {\n  Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler('barchartJS', function(arg) {\n    console.log(arg);    \n    const ctx = document.getElementById('myChart');\n\n    new Chart(ctx, {\n      type: 'bar',\n      data: {\n        labels: arg.labels,\n        datasets: [{\n          label: arg.label,\n          data: arg.data,\n          borderWidth: arg.borderWidth\n        }]\n      },\n      options: {\n        scales: {\n          y: {\n            beginAtZero: true\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }); \n  })\n});\n```\nWe will add elements to the `R/app_ui.R` file to generate the parameters to be passed to our handler:\n\n- `arg.labels` will be a vector of 5 character strings, randomly chosen from the letters of the latin alphabet.\n- `arg.label` will be a character string, randomly chosen from the letters of the latin alphabet.\n- `arg.data` will be a vector of 5 integer numbers, randomly chosen between 1 and 100.\n- `arg.borderWidth` will be an integer, randomly chosen between 1 and 5.\n\nThe display of the chart will be triggered by clicking a \"Show Barplot\" button.\n\nHere is the content of our `R/app_ui.R` file:\n\n``` r\napp_ui <- function(request) {\n\ttagList(\n\t\t# Leave this function for adding external resources\n\t\tgolem_add_external_resources(),\n\t\t# Your application UI logic\n\t\tfluidPage(\n\t\t\th1(\"golemchartjs\"),\n\t\t\tactionButton(\n\t\t\t\tinputId = \"showbarplot\",\n\t\t\t\tlabel = \"Show Barplot\"\n\t\t\t),\n\t\t\ttags$div(\n\t\t\t\ttags$canvas(id = \"myChart\")\n\t\t\t)\n\t\t)\n\t)\n}\n```\n\nAnd the content of the `R/app_server.R` file :\n\n``` r\napp_server <- function(input, output, session) {\n\tobserveEvent(input$showbarplot, {\n\t\tapp_labels <- sample(letters, 5)\n\t\tapp_label <- paste0(sample(letters, 10), collapse = \"\")\n\t\tapp_data <- sample(1:100, 5)\n\t\tapp_borderWidth <- sample(1:5, 1)\n\n\t\tgolem::invoke_js(\n\t\t\t\"barchartJS\",\n\t\t\tlist(\n\t\t\t\tlabels = app_labels,\n\t\t\t\tlabel = app_label,\n\t\t\t\tdata = app_data,\n\t\t\t\tborderWidth = app_borderWidth\n\t\t\t)\n\t\t)\n\t})\n}\n```\n\nHere are the key points to remember:\n\n- The first parameter in the call to `golem::invoke_js()` is the name of the JavaScript handler.\n- The following parameters are the elements to be passed as arguments to our handler. They should be passed in a named list where the names correspond to the elements in the `arg` object of our handler.\n\nLet's run our application with `golem::run_dev()` and verify that everything works as expected!\n\n<img src=\"img/03-premier_chart_from_invoke.gif\" width=\"80%\" />\n\nCongratulations! 👏 \n\nIn addition to the displayed chart, we can see that the JavaScript console in the browser correctly shows the content of the `arg` object, including its 4 sub-elements: `labels`, `label`, `data`, and `borderWidth`.\n\nAnd if you click the button again, what happens?\n\n<img src=\"img/04-graphique_bloque.gif\" width=\"80%\" />\n\nThe chart does not update; it remains stuck on the first chart! 😮\n\nThe JavaScript console indicates that the `arg` object has indeed been updated, but the chart does not refresh. Additionally, an error message appears in the JavaScript console: \"Error: Canvas is already in use. Chart with ID '0' must be destroyed before the canvas with ID 'myChart' can be reused.\"\n\nLet's try to understand what's happening: in the `R/app_ui.R` file, we added a `canvas` element with the ID \"myChart\" (with `tags$canvas(id = \"myChart\")`). This element is used to display the chart. When we click the \"Show Barplot\" button, a new chart is generated and displayed in this element. However, the previous chart is not destroyed, and the error message indicates that the \"canvas\" is already in use.\n\nThe application code for this step is available here: https://github.com/ymansiaux/golemchartjs/tree/step2\n\n### Why isn't the chart updating?\n\nTo find the answer, we need to refer back to the Chart.js documentation. We can read in the <a href=\"https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/developers/api.html#destroy\" target=\"_blank\"> \".destroy()\"</a> section that in order to reuse the HTML \"canvas\" element for displaying a new chart, it is necessary to destroy the previous chart.\n\nThere is also a command <a href=\"https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/developers/api.html#update-mode\" target=\"_blank\"> \".update()\"</a> for updating an existing chart. This method seems more appropriate here, as we are using the same type of chart, with only a few parameters changing. The `.update()` method allows updating an existing chart without having to destroy and recreate it, which will be less \"brutal\" visually (with a chart disappearing and then reappearing). However, the `.destroy()` method should be kept in mind for cases where we want to radically change the type of chart, for example.\n\nUpdating a chart implies that a chart has already been generated once. Therefore, we need to modify our JavaScript handler to account for this and find a way to detect the existence of a chart on our page. For this, we will refer again to the Chart.js documentation, particularly the `getChart` method: https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/developers/api.html#static-getchart-key.\n\nThe command to use is in the following form: `const chart = Chart.getChart(\"canvas-id\");`. According to the documentation, if the chart exists, the variable `chart` will contain the Chart.js object associated with the HTML \"canvas\" element. If the chart does not exist, the variable `chart` will be `undefined`.\n\nFor this command to work, we need to replace \"canvas-id\" with the ID of our \"canvas\", which is \"myChart\" here: `const chart = Chart.getChart(\"myChart\");`\n\nLet's restart our application. We indeed find that the `chart` object is `undefined` as long as the chart has not been created, and it correctly reflects this status afterwards.\n\n<img src=\"img/04bis-undefined_or_not.gif\" width=\"80%\" />\n\nWe can adapt our code as follows:\n\n- If `chart` is `undefined`, we create a new chart.\n  \n- If `chart` is not `undefined`, we update the existing chart.\n\nWe adapt our handler by referring to the documentation for the `.update()` method: https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/developers/api.html#update-mode\n\n``` javascript\n$(document).ready(function () {\n  Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler(\"barchartJS\", function (arg) {\n    console.log(arg);\n    const ctx = document.getElementById(\"myChart\");\n\n    const chart = Chart.getChart(\"myChart\");\n\n    if (chart == undefined) {\n      console.log(\"Creating a new chart\");\n      new Chart(ctx, {\n        type: \"bar\",\n        data: {\n          labels: arg.labels,\n          datasets: [\n            {\n              label: arg.label,\n              data: arg.data,\n              borderWidth: arg.borderWidth,\n            },\n          ],\n        },\n        options: {\n          scales: {\n            y: {\n              beginAtZero: true,\n            },\n          },\n        },\n      });\n    } else {\n      console.log(\"Updating an existing chart\");\n      chart.data.labels = arg.labels;\n      chart.data.datasets[0].label = arg.label;\n      chart.data.datasets[0].data = arg.data;\n      chart.data.datasets[0].borderWidth = arg.borderWidth;\n      chart.update();\n    }\n  });\n});\n\n```\n\nThis example is a bit more complex than those seen so far:\n\n- Retrieve the Chart.js object associated with the HTML \"canvas\" element using the method `Chart.getChart(\"myChart\")`.\n\n- Check if this object is `undefined`: if it is, use the code that has been working until now to create a new chart.\n\n- If it is not `undefined`, overwrite the configuration elements you want to update and then use the `.update()` method. Note the specifics of handling configuration elements: `chart.data.labels = arg.labels` for the labels, `chart.data.datasets[0].label = arg.label` for the label, etc. Use `.` to access object properties, with each `.` allowing access to a deeper level of \"depth\". It is also important to note that array indexing starts at 0 in JavaScript, not at 1 like in R.\n\nAfter all these efforts, let's see if everything is back in order 😄!\n\n<img src=\"img/05-graphique_debloque.gif\" width=\"80%\" />\n\nPhew, everything is OK this time! 🥲\n\nWe've touched on a more complex case of using a JavaScript library in a `{shiny}` application. It is crucial to understand the library's functioning by delving into the depths of its documentation. Moreover, one of the advantages of using a very popular library is that you can often find help on <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40056555/destroy-chart-js-bar-graph-to-redraw-other-graph-in-same-canvas\" target=\"_blank\"> StackOverflow</a> 😊 (here is an example of using the `.destroy()` method).\n\nFeel free to go further in customizing your chart, such as changing the bar colors: https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/general/colors.html and https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/bar.html. \n\nThe best way to learn is to try reproducing examples from the documentation.\n\nThe application code for this step is available here: https://github.com/ymansiaux/golemchartjs/tree/step3\n\n## Creating a Scatter Plot with Chart.js\n\nWe will attempt to create a scatter plot with Chart.js. To develop our code, we will rely on the Chart.js documentation: https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/scatter.html.\n\nAs before, our code will be stored in a JS handler. Therefore, we will add a new handler in the `dev/02_dev.R` file:\n\n``` r\ngolem::add_js_handler(\"scatterplotJS\")\n```\n\nThe documentation is slightly different from that provided for bar charts. We will need to adapt our handler accordingly. We identify an element `config`, which will include the `type`, `data`, and `options` elements we have already seen. There is also a `data` element containing `datasets` and `labels`.\n\nWe will fill in the skeleton of our handler with the JavaScript code from the Chart.js documentation. Initially, we will leave out the \"update\" part.\n\n``` javascript\n$(document).ready(function () {\n  Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler(\"scatterplotJS\", function (arg) {\n    const ctx = document.getElementById(\"myChart2\");\n\n    const data = {\n      datasets: [\n        {\n          label: \"Scatter Dataset\",\n          data: [\n            {\n              x: -10,\n              y: 0,\n            },\n            {\n              x: 0,\n              y: 10,\n            },\n            {\n              x: 10,\n              y: 5,\n            },\n            {\n              x: 0.5,\n              y: 5.5,\n            },\n          ],\n          backgroundColor: \"rgb(255, 99, 132)\",\n        },\n      ],\n    };\n\n    const config = {\n      type: \"scatter\",\n      data: data,\n      options: {\n        scales: {\n          x: {\n            type: \"linear\",\n            position: \"bottom\",\n          },\n        },\n      },\n    };\n    new Chart(ctx, config);\n  });\n});\n\n```\n\nOur JS handler \"scatterplotJS\" is ready! We need to add the \"div\" and \"canvas\" to the UI to display the generated chart. We need to modify the HTML ID of our \"canvas\" to avoid any conflict with the bar chart. It will be named \"myChart2\" here.\n\nNote that there is a slightly different syntax compared to the code used for the bar chart, where the call to \"new Chart\" was made directly with the `data` and `options` elements. Here, we store these elements in `data` and `config` variables before passing them to `new Chart`.\n\nNext, we add the following to the `R/app_ui.R` file:\n\n``` r\nh1(\"Scatterplot\"),\nactionButton(\n\tinputId = \"showscatterplot\",\n\tlabel = \"Show Scatterplot\"\n),\ntags$div(\n\ttags$canvas(id = \"myChart2\")\n)\n```\n\nWe add the following to the `R/app_server.R` file:\n\n``` r\n  observeEvent(input$showscatterplot, {\n    golem::invoke_js(\n      \"scatterplotJS\",\n      list(\n      )\n    )\n  })\n```\n\nOur handler does not use any elements passed from R. However, it is necessary to pass an empty list as an argument to ensure the proper functioning of `golem::invoke_js()`.\n\nLet's run your application with `golem::run_dev()` and verify that everything works as expected!\n\n<img src=\"img/06-scatterplot_basique.gif\" width=\"80%\" />\n\nThe chart from the documentation works! 🎉\n\nNow, let's go further by passing our own data as input.\n\nThe application code for this step is available here: https://github.com/ymansiaux/golemchartjs/tree/step4\n\n### An example with the iris dataset\n\nWe will use the `iris` dataset to generate a scatter plot. We will pass as arguments to our JS handler the data from the `Sepal.Length` and `Sepal.Width` columns.\n\nAs with the bar chart, we will use elements passed from R through the `arg` object in JavaScript.\n\nWe modify the `data` object to include a legend title and, most importantly, the data. To observe the elements passed from R, we add a call to `console.log()`.\n\n``` javascript\nconsole.log(arg);\nconst data = {\n  datasets: [\n    {\n      label: arg.label,\n      data: arg.data,\n      backgroundColor: \"rgb(255, 99, 132)\",\n    },\n  ],\n};\n```\t\n\nAs a reminder, in the example from the documentation, the data is passed in the form of an \"array of dictionaries\". Each dictionary contains the keys `x` and `y` for the point coordinates.\n\n``` javascript\ndata: [{\n    x: -10,\n    y: 0\n  }, {\n    x: 0,\n    y: 10\n  }, {\n    x: 10,\n    y: 5\n  }, {\n    x: 0.5,\n    y: 5.5\n}]\n```\n\nLet's try to pass the contents of the `Sepal.Length` and `Sepal.Width` columns via a list. We make the following modification in `R/app_server.R`:\n\n``` r\nobserveEvent(input$showscatterplot, {\n\tgolem::invoke_js(\n\t\t\"scatterplotJS\",\n\t\tlist(\n\t\t\tlabel = \"My scatterplot\",\n\t\t\tdata = list(\n\t\t\t\tx = iris$Sepal.Length,\n\t\t\t\ty = iris$Sepal.Width\n\t\t\t)\n\t\t)\n\t)\n})\n```\n\nWe restart our application, and unfortunately, nothing shows up!\n\n<img src=\"img/07-scatterplot_KO.gif\" width=\"80%\" />\n\nThanks to the `console.log()` call in our handler, we can observe the content of the `arg` object in the JavaScript console of the browser. We notice that the data passed is not in the correct format. Here, we get an array of two elements, the first containing the values of `Sepal.Length` and the second containing the values of `Sepal.Width`, which is not the expected format.\n\nHere, we need to do some work on the R side to transform our data into the expected format.\n\nIf we display a JSON preview of the data we passed as input, indeed the rendering is incorrect.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\njsonlite::toJSON(\n\tlist(\n\t\tx = iris$Sepal.Length,\n\t\ty = iris$Sepal.Width\n\t)\n)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n{\"x\":[5.1,4.9,4.7,4.6,5,5.4,4.6,5,4.4,4.9],\"y\":[3.5,3,3.2,3.1,3.6,3.9,3.4,3.4,2.9,3.1]} \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nFor manipulating lists, the `{purrr}` package is a top choice.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnew_data <- purrr::transpose(\n\tlist(\n\t\tx = iris$Sepal.Length,\n\t\ty = iris$Sepal.Width\n\t)\n)\njsonlite::toJSON(\n\tnew_data,\n\tauto_unbox = TRUE\n)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[{\"x\":5.1,\"y\":3.5},{\"x\":4.9,\"y\":3},{\"x\":4.7,\"y\":3.2},{\"x\":4.6,\"y\":3.1},{\"x\":5,\"y\":3.6},{\"x\":5.4,\"y\":3.9},{\"x\":4.6,\"y\":3.4},{\"x\":5,\"y\":3.4},{\"x\":4.4,\"y\":2.9},{\"x\":4.9,\"y\":3.1}] \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe rendering seems to be more in line with what is expected by Chart.js. Therefore, we will modify our code to pass the data in this manner.\n\n``` r\nobserveEvent(input$showscatterplot, {\n\tgolem::invoke_js(\n\t\t\"scatterplotJS\",\n\t\tlist(\n\t\t\tlabel = \"My scatterplot\",\n\t\t\tdata = purrr::transpose(\n\t\t\t\tlist(\n\t\t\t\t\tx = iris$Sepal.Length,\n\t\t\t\t\ty = iris$Sepal.Width\n\t\t\t\t)\n\t\t\t)\n\t\t)\n\t)\n})\n```\n\nLet's observe the result:\n\n<img src=\"img/08-scatterplot_OK.gif\" width=\"80%\" />\n\nThis time it's good! 😊 We can see in the JavaScript console that the data has indeed been passed in the correct format.\n\nThe application code for this step is available here: https://github.com/ymansiaux/golemchartjs/tree/step5\n\n### A Little Extra Polish\n\nOur chart still lacks titles for the axes! To find out how to do this, the documentation comes to our rescue once again: https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/axes/labelling.html#scale-title-configuration.\n\nWe need to add a `title` object to our existing `scales` object. Each axis, \"x\" and \"y\", is an object within the `scales` object and can have a title along with its associated parameters (color, font, etc.).\n\nWe will add a `title` element to the `x` object within our `scales` object. Several parameters are customizable, and we will need to modify the `text` parameter to set the title for each axis and the `display` parameter to show them, as this parameter is set to `false` by default (**note the different boolean notation between JavaScript and R**: `true/false` VS `TRUE/FALSE`).\n\nThe documentation sometimes lacks examples, so we can also rely on StackOverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27910719/in-chart-js-set-chart-title-name-of-x-axis-and-y-axis. However, be careful with the version of Chart.js used, as parameters may vary.\n\nIn our JS handler, we will add an `xAxisTitle` parameter and a `yAxisTitle` parameter.\n\n``` javascript\nconst config = {\n    type: 'scatter',\n    data: data,\n    options: {\n      scales: {\n        x: {\n          type: 'linear',\n          position: 'bottom',\n          title: {\n            display: true,\n            text: arg.xAxisTitle\n            }\n          },\n        y: {\n          title: {\n            display: true,\n            text: arg.yAxisTitle\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  };\n```\n\nBe cautious once again about the syntax difference between JavaScript and R. Parameters are passed in the form `display: true` rather than `display = TRUE`, for example. Confusing `:` with `=` can easily occur and result in non-functional code.\n\nIn our `R/app_server.R` file, we will add the `xAxisTitle` and `yAxisTitle` elements to the list passed as an argument to our handler.\n\n``` r\nobserveEvent(input$showscatterplot, {\n\tgolem::invoke_js(\n\t\t\"scatterplotJS\",\n\t\tlist(\n\t\t\tlabel = \"My scatterplot\",\n\t\t\tdata = purrr::transpose(\n\t\t\t\tlist(\n\t\t\t\t\tx = iris$Sepal.Length,\n\t\t\t\t\ty = iris$Sepal.Width\n\t\t\t\t)\n\t\t\t),\n\t\t\txAxisTitle = \"Sepal Length\",\n\t\t\tyAxisTitle = \"Sepal Width\"\n\t\t)\n\t)\n})\n```\n\nAnd here's the result in our application:\n\n<img src=\"img/09_scatterplot_axislabels.gif\" width=\"80%\" />\n\nThe application code for this step is available here: https://github.com/ymansiaux/golemchartjs/tree/step6\n\n### Going further with the scatter plot\n\nAdditional modifications can be made to enhance the chart:\n\n  - Modify the title\n  \n  - Change the fill color of the points and their border color\n\nHere are the resources used to produce the code that we will present shortly:\n\n  - Title: https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/configuration/title.html\n\n    The title should be included in a `plugins` object, which in turn is included in the `options` object.\n\n  - Point Colors: https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/line.html#point-styles\n\n    The color of the points will be managed within the `datasets` object.\n\nWe will offer users the ability to set the chart title, its color, and the color of the points through `shiny` inputs (which will be a good way to revisit the \"update\"-related issues 😉).\n\nBelow is a preview of the chart created here (without functional \"update\" for now):\n\n<img src=\"img/10_fullscatter.gif\" width=\"80%\" />\n\nThe handler code has been completed to account for these new elements:\n\n``` javascript\t\n$(document).ready(function () {\n  Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler(\"scatterplotJS\", function (arg) {\n    const ctx = document.getElementById(\"myChart2\");\n\n    console.log(arg);\n\n    const data = {\n      datasets: [\n        {\n          label: arg.label,\n          data: arg.data,\n          borderColor: arg.pointBorderColor,\n          backgroundColor: arg.pointBackGroundColor,\n        },\n      ],\n    };\n\n    const plugins = {\n      title: {\n        display: true,\n        text: arg.mainTitle,\n        color: arg.mainTitleColor,\n      },\n    };\n\n    const config = {\n      type: \"scatter\",\n      data: data,\n      options: {\n        plugins: plugins,\n        scales: {\n          x: {\n            type: \"linear\",\n            position: \"bottom\",\n            title: {\n              display: true,\n              text: arg.xAxisTitle,\n            },\n          },\n          y: {\n            title: {\n              display: true,\n              text: arg.yAxisTitle,\n            },\n          },\n        },\n      },\n    };\n    new Chart(ctx, config);\n  });\n});\n```\n\nIn `R/app_ui.R`, elements have been added to allow the user to pass the necessary parameters:\n\n``` r\nh1(\"Scatterplot\"),\ntextInput(\n\tinputId = \"scatterplot_title\",\n\tlabel = \"Scatterplot Title\",\n\tvalue = \"ChartJS rocks !\"\n),\nselectInput(\n\tinputId = \"title_color\",\n\tlabel = \"Title Color\",\n\tchoices = c(\"brown\", \"orange\", \"purple\"),\n\tselected = \"brown\"\n),\nselectInput(\n  inputId = \"points_background_color\",\n\tlabel = \"Points Background Color\",\n\tchoices = c(\"red\", \"blue\", \"green\"),\n\tselected = \"red\"\n),\nactionButton(\n  inputId = \"showscatterplot\",\n\tlabel = \"Show Scatterplot\"\n),\ntags$div(\n\ttags$canvas(id = \"myChart2\")\n)\n```\n\nFinally, in `R/app_server.R`, we add the necessary elements to pass the parameters to our handler:\n\n``` r\nobserveEvent(input$showscatterplot, {\n\t\tgolem::invoke_js(\n\t\t\t\"scatterplotJS\",\n\t\t\tlist(\n\t\t\t\tlabel = \"My scatterplot\",\n\t\t\t\tdata = purrr::transpose(\n\t\t\t\t\tlist(\n\t\t\t\t\t\tx = iris$Sepal.Length,\n\t\t\t\t\t\ty = iris$Sepal.Width\n\t\t\t\t\t)\n\t\t\t\t),\n\t\t\t\txAxisTitle = \"Sepal Length\",\n\t\t\t\tyAxisTitle = \"Sepal Width\",\n\t\t\t\tmainTitle = input$scatterplot_title,\n\t\t\t\tmainTitleColor = input$title_color,\n\t\t\t\tpointBorderColor = \"black\",\n\t\t\t\tpointBackGroundColor = input$points_background_color\n\t\t\t)\n\t\t)\n\t})\n```\n\nThe application code for this step is available here: https://github.com/ymansiaux/golemchartjs/tree/step7\n\nWe still need to include the `.update()` method to account for updates to `shiny` inputs related to the title and the color of the points.\n\nWe will use the approach from the previous chart to modify our JS handler accordingly.\n\n``` javascript\t\n$(document).ready(function () {\n  Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler(\"scatterplotJS\", function (arg) {\n    const ctx = document.getElementById(\"myChart2\");\n\n    console.log(arg);\n\n    const chart2 = Chart.getChart(\"myChart2\");\n\n    if (chart2 == undefined) {\n      console.log(\"Creating a new chart\");\n\n      const data = {\n        datasets: [\n          {\n            label: arg.label,\n            data: arg.data,\n            borderColor: arg.pointBorderColor,\n            backgroundColor: arg.pointBackGroundColor,\n          },\n        ],\n      };\n\n      const plugins = {\n        title: {\n          display: true,\n          text: arg.mainTitle,\n          color: arg.mainTitleColor,\n        },\n      };\n\n      const config = {\n        type: \"scatter\",\n        data: data,\n        options: {\n          plugins: plugins,\n          scales: {\n            x: {\n              type: \"linear\",\n              position: \"bottom\",\n              title: {\n                display: true,\n                text: arg.xAxisTitle,\n              },\n            },\n            y: {\n              title: {\n                display: true,\n                text: arg.yAxisTitle,\n              },\n            },\n          },\n        },\n      };\n      new Chart(ctx, config);\n    } else {\n      console.log(\"Updating an existing chart\");\n      chart2.data.datasets[0].backgroundColor = arg.pointBackGroundColor;\n      chart2.options.plugins.title.text = arg.mainTitle;\n      chart2.options.plugins.title.color = arg.mainTitleColor;\n      chart2.update();\n    }\n  });\n});\n```\n\nLet's observe the result:\n\n<img src=\"img/11_fullscatter_with_update.gif\" width=\"80%\" />\n\nWell done! 🎉\n\nThe application code for this step is available here: https://github.com/ymansiaux/golemchartjs/tree/step8\n\n### Modifying the tooltip (advanced level)\n\nWe will look to modify the tooltip that appears when hovering over a point on the chart. In addition to changing its title, we want to display the row number from the dataset corresponding to the hovered point, as well as the corresponding values of `Sepal.Length` and `Sepal.Width`.\n\nHere are the resources used:\n\n- Tooltip title: https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/configuration/tooltip.html#tooltip-callbacks\n  \n- Tooltip content: https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/configuration/tooltip.html#tooltip-callbacks and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anseX1ePfUw\n\nThis part will be more complex than the previous ones. But we will manage it! 💪\n\nThe `plugins` object, used previously to manage the chart title, contains a `tooltip` element, which in turn contains a `callbacks` element. It is within this element that we can modify the title and content of the tooltip. Most tooltip elements can be configured via a function call that takes a `context` element as input. This is a JavaScript object that contains several items related to the hovered point. We will explore the content of this object to extract the information we need later when customizing the tooltip content.\n\nWe modify our JS handler by including a fixed title (we could also have passed it as a parameter):\n\n``` javascript\t\nconst tooltip = {\n  callbacks: {\n    title: function (context) {\n      return \"Tooltip title\";\n    },\n  },\n};\n\nconst plugins = {\n  title: {\n    display: true,\n    text: arg.mainTitle,\n    color: arg.mainTitleColor,\n  },\n  tooltip: tooltip\n};\n```\n\nLet's see if it works:\n\n<img src=\"img/12_tooltip_title.gif\" width=\"80%\" />\n\nThe application code for this step is available here: https://github.com/ymansiaux/golemchartjs/tree/step9\n\nLet's proceed with customizing the tooltip content!\n\nIn this step, we will modify the `label` parameter in the `tooltip` object. To refine our code, we will use the `debugger` function, which we haven't used so far! If you are familiar with using `browser()` in R, `debugger` is its JavaScript equivalent. It allows you to pause the code execution and open the browser console to explore the arguments passed to a function.\n\nLet's modify our handler:\n\n``` javascript\t\nconst tooltip = {\n  callbacks: {\n    title: function (context) {\n      return \"Tooltip title\";\n    },\n    label: function(context) {\n      debugger;\n    }\n  },\n};\n\nconst plugins = {\n  title: {\n    display: true,\n    text: arg.mainTitle,\n    color: arg.mainTitleColor,\n  },\n  tooltip: tooltip,\n};\n```\n\nWe add a call to the JavaScript `debugger` in the `label` function of the `callbacks` object. We restart our application:\n\n<img src=\"img/13_debugger.gif\" width=\"80%\" />\n\nWhen hovering over a point on the chart, code execution is paused and the browser console opens. We can then explore the content of the `context` object passed to the `label` function.\n\nWe can identify the information that will be useful:\n\n- The row number in the dataset: `context.dataIndex`\n\n- The values of the point: `context.formattedValue`\n\nWe can then construct a customized tooltip (remembering to remove the `debugger` call 😉):\n\n``` javascript\t\nconst tooltip = {\n  callbacks: {\n    title: function (context) {\n      return \"Tooltip title\";\n    },\n    label: function (context) {\n      lab =\n        \"Line number: \" +\n        context.dataIndex +\n        \" values: \" +\n        context.formattedValue;\n      return lab;\n      },\n  },\n};\n\nconst plugins = {\n  title: {\n    display: true,\n    text: arg.mainTitle,\n    color: arg.mainTitleColor,\n  },\n  tooltip: tooltip,\n};\n```\n\n<img src=\"img/14_final.gif\" width=\"80%\" />\n\nMission accomplished! 🚀\n\nThe code for this step is available here: [https://github.com/ymansiaux/golemchartjs/tree/step10](https://github.com/ymansiaux/golemchartjs/tree/step10)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAfter our initial foray into calling JavaScript code from R with the sweetalert2 library, we have now explored using a data visualization library.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\n- Always try to get the documentation examples working before adapting them to your application.\n- Use `jsonlite::toJSON()` to verify that the data passed is in the format expected by the library.\n- Keep in mind that sometimes you need to \"update\" or \"destroy\" objects on a web page.\n- Use `console.log()` or `debugger` to see the contents of a JavaScript object passed as an argument to a function.\n\nAfter overcoming some challenging moments, we can see the possibilities offered by JavaScript data visualization libraries. You can achieve a high degree of customization for your charts, and Chart.js offers many features. Documentation, combined with research on discussion forums, can help solve problems that may seem insurmountable at first.\n\nFeel free to dive into integrating JavaScript libraries into your `{shiny}` applications. It can be an excellent way to break new ground and offer interactive and customized charts to your users.\n\nSee you soon for new adventures! 🚀",
