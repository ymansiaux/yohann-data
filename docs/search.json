Passionate about knowledge sharing and open source, I enjoy engaging with my peers and learners and contributing to a dynamic and collaborative community.\nI used to have a blog a few years ago, based on Hugo (in French only).\nI have decided to give a try to Quarto Websites. This new site aims at sharing my thoughts and knowledge about R, data science, epidemiology-related stuff.\nBesides videos and blog posts present on this website, you can find some of my contributions to open source projects on Github :\n\n{shinygouv} - Use the French Governmental Design System (DSFR) on you shiny apps‚Äù\n{lozen} - Github and Gitlab project management tools for devs and lead dev‚Äù\n{fusen} - Inflates a Rmarkdown file to magically create a package.‚Äù\n\nI hope you will enjoy reading my posts. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions !"
