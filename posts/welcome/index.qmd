Hi folks !

I am a R trainer and developer. Passionate about knowledge sharing and open source, I enjoy engaging with my peers and learners and contributing to a dynamic and collaborative community.

I used to have a blog a few years ago, based on Hugo ([in French only](https://ymansiaux-data.netlify.app/)).

I have decided to give a try to Quarto Websites. This new site aims at sharing my thoughts and knowledge about R, data science, epidemiology-related stuff.  

Besides videos and blog posts present on this website, you can find some of my contributions to open source projects on Github :

- [{shinygouv} - Use the French Governmental Design System (DSFR) on you shiny apps"](https://github.com/spyrales/shinygouv)
  
- [{lozen} - Github and Gitlab project management tools for devs and lead dev"](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/lozen)

- [{fusen} - Inflates a Rmarkdown file to magically create a package."](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/fusen)

I hope you will enjoy reading my posts. Feel free to [contact me](https://ymansiaux.github.io/yohann-data/about.html) if you have any questions !
