Welcome to my blog !

I am a R trainer and developer at [ThinkR](https://thinkr.fr/). I used to have a blog a few years ago, based on Hugo ([in French only](https://ymansiaux-data.netlify.app/)).

I have decided to give a try to Quarto Websites. This new site aims at sharing my thoughts and knowledge about R, data science, epidemiology-related stuff.  

Some of my posts are also available in ThinkR websites :

- [Rtask website - English and French](https://rtask.thinkr.fr/blog/)
- [ThinkR website - French](https://thinkr.fr/blog/)
